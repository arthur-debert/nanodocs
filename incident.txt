Team,

As you are likely aware, an incident occurred this morning involving a company vehicle and Ms. Meredith Palmer. While details are still being gathered (and frankly, are a bit hazy), it appears a minor... collision took place in the parking lot.

To clarify: Ms. Palmer is currently receiving medical attention. The vehicle, a Chrysler Sebring convertible, sustained minimal damage (a slight dent, some grass stains). I, Michael Scott, was operating the vehicle at the time. I was, in fact, attempting to bring her to the hospital, after hitting her.

In the interest of transparency and to prevent further "misunderstandings," I will be hosting a mandatory safety seminar this afternoon, focusing on defensive driving and the proper use of reverse gear. Please bring a pen and paper, and maybe a helmet.

Michael Scott, Regional Manager.
