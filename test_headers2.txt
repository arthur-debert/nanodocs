This is a second test file.

When using the --header-seq option, this file will be the second in the sequence.

For example:
- With --header-seq=numerical, this will be "2. test_headers2.txt"
- With --header-seq=letter, this will be "b. test_headers2.txt"
- With --header-seq=roman, this will be "ii. test_headers2.txt"
