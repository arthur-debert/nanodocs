This is a test file to demonstrate the new header options.

It has multiple lines of text to show how the headers work.

The headers can now be:
1. Hidden with --no-header
2. Sequenced with --header-seq=numerical (1., 2., etc.)
3. Sequenced with --header-seq=letter (a., b., etc.)
4. Sequenced with --header-seq=roman (i., ii., etc.)
