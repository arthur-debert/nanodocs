How to address part(s) of files: 

Single lines
    
    <filename>:L<linue num> -> a specific line number from file name
    ex: readme.txt:L20 -> the 20th line of the file

Ranges: 
    <filename>:L<start>-<end>-> a range from lines start to end 
    ex: readme.txt:L20-24 -> lines 20 through 24 in readme.txt file

Multiples: 
    Both lines and ranges can be commbined, by separating them with commas. 
    In this case the L prefix is used in all of them.
    ex: 
        readme.txt:L14,L23-38,L40
        this gets lines 14, lines 23 trough 38 and lines 40

Invalid Lines: 
    If any line reference is not found we raised an error, even if other in the multiple are found
Repeted Lines: 
    We will not check for multiple repeated lines, nor any ordering issues
