Three ways to tell nanodoc which files to bundle:

1. INDIVIDUAL FILES:
   nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt file3.md
   Processes exactly these files in the order provided.

2. DIRECTORIES:
   nanodoc docs/
   Finds and processes all .txt and .md files in the directory and subdirectories.
   Files processed in alphabetical order.

3. BUNDLE FILES:
   nanodoc mybundle.txt
   Where mybundle.txt lists file paths, one per line:
   chapter1.txt
   images/diagram.md
   /absolute/path/to/notes.txt
