Three ways to tell nanodoc which files to bundle:

1. INDIVIDUAL FILES:
   nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt file3.md
   Processes exactly these files in the order provided.

2. DIRECTORIES:
   nanodoc docs/
   Finds and processes all .txt and .md files in the directory and subdirectories.
   Files processed in alphabetical order.

3. BUNDLE FILES:
   nanodoc mybundle.txt
   Where mybundle.txt lists file paths, one per line:
   chapter1.txt
   images/diagram.md
   /absolute/path/to/notes.txt

4. LIVE BUNDLE FILES:
   nanodoc livebundle.txt
   Where livebundle.txt can mix text and file paths:
   
   Introduction to the document
   chapter1.txt
   This text appears between chapters
   chapter2.txt
   Conclusion
   
   In live bundles, file paths are replaced with their content inline.
   No file titles or line number resets occur at file boundaries.
   This allows for seamless integration of content from multiple files.

   Example:
   If chapter1.txt contains "This is chapter 1 content" and
   chapter2.txt contains "This is chapter 2 content", the result will be:

   Introduction to the document
   This is chapter 1 content
   This text appears between chapters
   This is chapter 2 content
   Conclusion
