# Example Live Bundle

This is a demonstration of the live bundle feature in nanodoc.
Below, we'll include the content of the specifying_files.txt document:

../specifying_files.txt

As you can see, the file content is seamlessly integrated into this document.
We can also include specific sections of files using line references:

../live_bundles.txt:L20-30

This makes it easy to create composite documents that include content from
multiple sources with your own commentary and transitions between sections.

# Inline File Inclusion

Live bundles also support inline file inclusion using the @[file path] syntax.
For example, this sentence includes @[../live_bundles.txt:L5-5] as an inline quote.

With this syntax, the file content is inserted inline with all line breaks removed.
This is useful for including short snippets of text within a paragraph without
disrupting the flow of the document.

# Conclusion

Live bundles are a powerful way to create dynamic documents that combine
content from multiple files without the visual separation of traditional bundles.
