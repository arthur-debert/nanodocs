Live Bundles in Nanodoc
=====================

Live bundles are a powerful feature in nanodoc that allow you to create documents
that seamlessly integrate content from multiple files with your own text.

What are Live Bundles?
---------------------

A live bundle is a text file that contains a mix of:
- Regular text content
- File paths that point to existing files

When nanodoc processes a live bundle, it replaces each file path with the
content of that file, creating a single cohesive document.

Key Differences from Traditional Bundles
---------------------------------------

Traditional bundles:
- Contain only file paths, one per line
- Each file is processed separately with its own title and optional line numbering
- Clear visual separation between files

Live bundles:
- Can mix text and file paths
- File paths are replaced with their content inline
- No file titles or line number resets at file boundaries
- Seamless integration of content

Creating a Live Bundle
--------------------

To create a live bundle, simply create a text file with your content and file paths:

```
Introduction to my document

/path/to/chapter1.txt

This text will appear between chapters

/path/to/chapter2.txt

Conclusion
```

Each line that contains only a valid file path will be replaced with the content
of that file. All other lines will be preserved as-is.

Inline File Inclusion
-------------------

Live bundles also support inline file inclusion using the @[file path] syntax:

```
This paragraph includes @[/path/to/quote.txt] right in the middle of the text.
```

With this syntax, the file content is inserted inline with all line breaks removed.
This is useful for including short snippets of text within a paragraph without
disrupting the flow of the document.

For example, if quote.txt contains:
```
To be or not to be
That is the question
```

The result will be:
```
This paragraph includes To be or not to be That is the question right in the middle of the text.
```

You can include multiple inline file references in a single line:
```
As @[author.txt] once said: "@[quote.txt]"
```

Using Line References
-------------------

You can also use line references to include specific parts of files:

```
Introduction

/path/to/file.txt:L10-20

Middle section

/path/to/file.txt:L50-60

Conclusion
```

Line references can also be used with inline file inclusion:
```
The most important part is @[document.txt:L42-45]
```

Example Use Cases
---------------

1. Creating composite documents with your own commentary between sections
2. Building tutorials that include code samples from actual files
3. Assembling documentation with custom introductions and transitions
4. Creating prompt templates with dynamic content from different sources
5. Including quotes or references inline without disrupting paragraph flow

Tips for Using Live Bundles
-------------------------

- Keep file paths on their own lines for clarity
- Use relative paths when possible for portability
- Consider using line references to include only relevant parts of files
- Test your live bundles to ensure file paths are correctly resolved
- Use inline inclusion (@[file]) for short snippets that should flow within text
- Use full-line inclusion for larger blocks of content

Command Line Usage
----------------

```
$ nanodoc my_live_bundle.txt
```

The output will be a single document with all file paths replaced by their content.
