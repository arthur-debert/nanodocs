OPTIONS:
-n     Per-file numbering: Each file starts from 1
-nn    Global numbering: Continues across all files

EXAMPLES:

With -n (per-file):
   1: First line in file1.txt
   2: Second line in file1.txt

   1: First line in file2.txt
   2: Second line in file2.txt

With -nn (global):
   1: First line in file1.txt
   2: Second line in file1.txt
   3: First line in file2.txt
