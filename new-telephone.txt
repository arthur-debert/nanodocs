All Employees,

To improve efficiency, or at least attempt to, we've implemented a new, state-of-the-art phone tree system. Please familiarize yourselves with the following options, and memorize them, as there will be a quiz.

For general inquiries (expect long wait times, and possibly a dial tone).
To complain about Dwight (please be specific, and provide photographic evidence if possible).
To request a meeting with Michael (good luck, and please bring a signed waiver).
If you're lost in the warehouse (and have been for over an hour).
If you're Jim, just hang up, and then email me a funny meme.
