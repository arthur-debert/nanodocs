UNDERSTANDING HOW NANODOC HANDLES FILES
======================================

Nanodoc provides flexible ways to specify which files to include in your documentation. There are three main approaches:

## 1. Individual Files

When you provide specific file paths as arguments, nanodoc will process each file directly:

    nanodoc file1.txt path/to/file2.md chapter3.txt

This processes exactly the files you specify, in the order provided.

## 2. Directories

If you provide a directory path, nanodoc automatically includes all .txt and .md files found within that directory (including subdirectories):

    nanodoc docs/

Files are processed in alphabetical order to ensure consistent output.

## 3. Bundle Files

A "bundle file" is a text file containing a list of file paths, one per line. This approach lets you maintain a consistent set of files to process:

    nanodoc my-bundle.txt

Where my-bundle.txt contains:

    chapter1.txt
    docs/chapter2.md
    /absolute/path/to/chapter3.txt

Each path in the bundle file can be relative or absolute.

NOTES
-----

- Bundle files must be provided as direct arguments to nanodoc (not discovered through directory scanning)
- Line numbers can be added using -n (per-file numbering) or -nn (global numbering)
- Use --toc to generate a table of contents with all included filenames
- Files are always separated by a header line containing the filename

The flexibility of these approaches allows you to organize your documentation however you prefer while making it easy to generate consistent combined documents.
