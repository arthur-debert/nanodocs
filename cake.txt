Attention all personnel,

Due to the recent, frankly appalling, "incident" involving the complete and utter decimation of an entire birthday cake by a single individual (no names, Dwight), we are implementing stringent, ironclad cake consumption guidelines. Each slice, and I mean every slice, must be meticulously documented with a detailed description of its texture, flavor profile, and emotional impact. Any deviation, even the slightest crumb out of place, will be immediately reported to HR (which, in this case, is also me, so prepare for a stern talking-to). I will also be monitoring cake consumption with a laser pointer.
